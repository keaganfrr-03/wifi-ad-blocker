Pi-hole setup guide for Raspberry Pi 4 with Jellyfin

Introduction
This guide explains how I installed and configured Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB) that already has Jellyfin running.

The goal was to set up a network-wide ad blocker while ensuring Jellyfin continued to work smoothly.

I document the challenges encountered, how they were solved, and tips for anyone attempting the same setup.

Operating System used: Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)
